  <h2>20 Collaborations in Book Art</h2> 
  <img id ="imageCollaborations" src="images/Grammer_Britt_Stadig_007.jpg" alt="20 Collaborations in Book Art"/>
 
  
    <p> I am currently in the process of collaborating with 20 individuals to produce 20 artist books. The idea was to choose visual artists who have never or seldom produce their art in the book form as well as a writer, a mathematician, a woodworker, and a scientist. My role varies. Some participants will work with me on structure alone while others will collaborate conceptually, visually, in addition to structurally. The intention of the project is to bring book art to a wider audience as well as demonstrate the creative potential within all artists to utilize the book form.</br></br>

The exhibition will utilize technology in order to connect the audience with the works. Book art is usually limited to one page spreads and kept under plexi glass. This is the only way to protect the art yet the book cannot fully be experienced by the viewer. Each book will be filmed and transformed into digital media so that visitors are able to utilize their smart phones to access all pages of each book on exhibit. Amanda McCadams of <a id="websiteLink" href = "http://www.digitalwondercabinet.com">Digital Wonder Cabinet</a> is the brains and talent behind this part of the project.</br></br>

The Nashville Public Library has been a great support to book art from the Wilson Collection to the book arts group that meets at the library.  20 artist books will be on exhibit in the library's gallery in February of 2014 as the first stop of a traveling exhibit. The participants live and work in Nashville.</p> </br></br>
